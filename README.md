# Flexbox and Responsive Design Practice

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **HTML and CSS** to practice various Flexbox properties and responsive design techniques. The primary focus is on understanding how Flexbox properties influence layout and alignment, ensuring a flexible and adaptive design.

### Alignment & Flex Sizing
- **align-content**: Controls the alignment of flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis.
- **align-self**: Allows individual flex items to override the align-items property.
- **align-items**: Defines how flex items are aligned along the cross axis.
- **flex-basis**: Specifies the initial size of a flex item before it grows or shrinks.
- **flex-grow**: Determines how much a flex item will grow relative to others.
- **flex-shrink**: Controls how flex items shrink if necessary.
- **flex shorthand**: A shorthand property that combines `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

### Flexbox Layout & Wrapping
- **flex-wrap**: Specifies whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines.
- **justify-content**: Defines alignment along the main axis.
- **flex-direction**: Determines the direction of the flex container (row, column, etc.).
